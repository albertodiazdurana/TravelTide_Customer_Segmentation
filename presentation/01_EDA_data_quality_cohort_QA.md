# Notebook 01: EDA Data Quality & Cohort - Q&A for Presentation

**Notebook:** `01_EDA_data_quality_cohort.ipynb`  
**Purpose:** Help prepare for stakeholder presentation  
**Date:** October 2025

---

## Business Context Questions

### Q1: Why did we define a specific cohort instead of using all users?

**Answer:**
We defined a specific cohort to focus on **engaged, convertible customers** who are worth investing in through a rewards program. Including all users would bias our analysis because:

- **New users** (signed up recently) lack behavioral patterns for meaningful segmentation
- **One-time browsers** never converted and may never return
- **Inactive users** won't respond to marketing campaigns
- **Test accounts** with invalid data (like the 2006 birth year anomaly) aren't real customers

The cohort represents users with sufficient behavioral data to enable accurate pattern detection and effective targeting.

---

### Q2: Who defined the cohort criteria, and what are they?

**Answer:**
**Elena Tarrant (Head of Marketing)** defined the cohort criteria:

1. **Date Range:** Sessions after January 4, 2023 (post-holiday, recent behavior)
2. **Activity Filter:** Users with >7 sessions (established engagement)
3. **Age Validation:** 18-100 years old (legal compliance, remove anomalies)

We added a fourth filter:
4. **Outlier Removal:** IQR method with 3.0x multiplier (data quality)

These criteria ensure we're analyzing customers with recent, meaningful engagement patterns.

---

### Q3: What is the final cohort size?

**Answer:**
- **5,765 users**
- **43,344 sessions**
- **7.52 sessions per user (average)**

This represents our qualified analytical cohort for the rewards program segmentation.

---

## Technical Decisions Questions

### Q4: How did you handle the 2006 birth year anomaly?

**Answer:**
We investigated the anomaly and found a spike in users born in 2006 (age 17 in 2023). Rather than assume it was an error, we applied Elena's age validation filter (18-100 years old), which naturally excluded these users since they're below the legal minimum age for the rewards program.

The visualization clearly showed this anomaly, and our age filter addressed it systematically rather than through arbitrary data manipulation.

---

### Q5: Why did you use the IQR method for outlier detection instead of Z-scores or percentile cutoffs?

**Answer:**
The **IQR (Inter-Quartile Range) method** is superior for travel data because:

1. **Distribution-agnostic:** Works with skewed data (travel spending is not normally distributed)
2. **Industry standard:** Widely recognized and interpretable
3. **Conservative:** Using 3.0x multiplier removes only extreme outliers
4. **Robust:** Not affected by the outliers themselves (unlike mean/standard deviation)

**Why not Z-scores?** Assumes normal distribution (travel data is heavily skewed)  
**Why not percentile cutoffs?** Too arbitrary; loses potentially valid data

Our approach removed only 8.36% of sessions - aggressive enough to improve quality, conservative enough to preserve real behavior.

---

### Q6: How did you resolve invalid hotel nights?

**Answer:**
We handled this **proactively in the SQL extraction query** using CASE logic:

```sql
CASE 
    WHEN h.nights IS NOT NULL AND h.nights > 0 THEN h.nights
    ELSE NULL
END as nights
```

This means:
- Only positive night values are loaded
- Invalid values (≤0) are set to NULL
- Bad data never enters the analysis pipeline

**Result:** 0 invalid hotel nights detected in the final dataset, confirming our query logic worked correctly.

---

### Q7: What outlier categories did you check?

**Answer:**
We checked three categories:

1. **Behavioral Metrics:** page_clicks
2. **Monetary Metrics:** base_fare_usd, hotel_price_per_room_night_usd, flight_discount_amount, hotel_discount_amount
3. **Trip Characteristics:** nights, rooms, seats, bags

Each metric was evaluated independently using the IQR method, and sessions with outliers in ANY category were flagged for removal.

---

### Q8: How much data did you lose through filtering?

**Answer:**

| Stage | Sessions | Users | % Lost (Sessions) |
|-------|----------|-------|-------------------|
| All Sessions (database) | ~varies | ~varies | - |
| After Date Filter (>2023-01-04) | ~varies | ~varies | - |
| After Activity Filter (>7 sessions) | 47,300 | 5,765 | - |
| After Age Filter (18-100 years) | 47,300 | 5,765 | 0% |
| After Outlier Removal | 43,344 | 5,765 | 8.36% |

**Key insight:** We maintained all 5,765 users while removing only extreme session outliers. This preserves our user base while improving data quality.

---

## Results Interpretation Questions

### Q9: What does "7.52 sessions per user" tell us?

**Answer:**
This metric indicates **moderate to high engagement** within our cohort:

- Users in our cohort have browsed/interacted with the platform multiple times
- They're not one-time visitors (which would show ~1 session per user)
- They're engaged enough to have established behavioral patterns for segmentation
- This validates Elena's >7 sessions filter as appropriate for identifying committed customers

---

### Q10: What were the booking conversion rates in the cohort?

**Answer:**
- **Flight Booking Rate:** 25.81% (11,186 flight bookings / 43,344 sessions)
- **Hotel Booking Rate:** 26.04% (11,287 hotel bookings / 43,344 sessions)
- **Cancellation Rate:** 0.26% (114 cancellations / 43,344 sessions)

These rates indicate:
- About 1 in 4 sessions results in a booking (healthy conversion)
- Hotel and flight bookings are roughly balanced
- Cancellations are rare (good customer satisfaction indicator)

---

### Q11: What age range is represented in the final cohort?

**Answer:**
**18 to 100 years old** (as defined by Elena's criteria)

This range:
- Ensures legal compliance (18+ requirement)
- Excludes the 2006 birth year anomaly (17-year-olds)
- Removes unrealistic ages (>100 years, likely data errors)
- Represents a realistic customer demographic for travel services

---

## Data Quality Questions

### Q12: How confident are you in the data quality after this notebook?

**Answer:**
**Very confident.** We addressed all major data quality issues:

1. **Age anomalies:** Investigated and filtered systematically
2. **Invalid hotel nights:** Prevented at extraction (0 invalid values)
3. **Statistical outliers:** Removed using robust IQR method (8.36% of sessions)
4. **Missing values:** Preserved sessions with partial data (LEFT JOINs)

The cleaned dataset is ready for feature engineering and segmentation with minimal risk of algorithmic bias from bad data.

---

### Q13: Why did you preserve sessions without bookings?

**Answer:**
**Browsing behavior is valuable for segmentation.**

Sessions without bookings tell us:
- User interest and research patterns
- Price sensitivity (if they browsed but didn't book)
- Engagement level (page clicks, session duration)
- Discount response behavior

These non-converting sessions help identify different customer types:
- **Window shoppers:** High engagement, low conversion
- **Price-sensitive researchers:** Many sessions before booking
- **Impulse bookers:** Few sessions, quick conversion

This behavioral diversity is critical for creating meaningful customer segments.

---

## Process Questions

### Q14: Why did you consolidate Week 1 Days 2-3 into one notebook?

**Answer:**
**Professional code organization and efficiency:**

1. **Reduced fragmentation:** 15 notebooks → 6 notebooks (60% reduction)
2. **Logical flow:** Data extraction → quality assessment → cohort finalization is one complete story
3. **Easier maintenance:** One file to update instead of two
4. **Better presentation:** Can explain entire cohort definition process in one narrative
5. **Industry standard:** ~400 lines per notebook is manageable and professional

The consolidation maintains all original functionality while improving code organization.

---

### Q15: What outputs did this notebook create?

**Answer:**
**5 deliverables:**

1. **Data:** `eda_cohort_qualified.csv` (43,344 sessions, 5,765 users)
2. **Report:** `eda_data_quality_report.csv` (16 quality metrics)
3. **Figure 1:** `eda_age_distribution.png` (birth year and age distributions)
4. **Figure 2:** `eda_data_quality_boxplots.png` (6 key metrics after cleaning)
5. **Figure 3:** `eda_cohort_funnel.png` (filtering stages visualization)

All outputs follow the organized folder structure: `../data/results/eda/` and `../outputs/figures/eda/`

---

## Next Steps Questions

### Q16: What happens next after this notebook?

**Answer:**
**Notebook 02: Behavioral Analysis** (Week 1 Days 3-5)

Will analyze:
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, location, sign-up patterns
- **Booking Behavior:** Flight vs. hotel preferences, trip characteristics
- **Engagement Patterns:** Session frequency, page clicks, conversion timing
- **Initial Insights:** Identify opportunities for segmentation

This deeper analysis will inform our feature engineering strategy in Week 2.

---

### Q17: Is this cohort definition final, or might it change?

**Answer:**
**This cohort is final for the current analysis** because:

1. It was explicitly defined by Elena (stakeholder)
2. It aligns with business objectives (engaged, convertible customers)
3. Data quality is validated and documented
4. User count (5,765) is sufficient for robust clustering

**However,** if business requirements change (e.g., Elena wants to include newer users or adjust activity thresholds), we can easily re-run the notebook with updated filters. The modular design supports this flexibility.

---

## Potential Stakeholder Concerns

### Q18: "Why did you remove 8% of the data? Aren't we losing valuable customers?"

**Answer:**
**We removed outlier sessions, not users.** All 5,765 users remain in the analysis.

The 8.36% of sessions we removed were extreme outliers (e.g., 500+ page clicks in one session, $50,000 flight fares) that would:
- Distort clustering algorithms
- Pull cluster centers toward unrealistic values
- Mask patterns in the 91.64% of normal customer behavior

**Analogy:** If analyzing typical grocery shopping, you wouldn't let a single $10,000 purchase distort your understanding of normal buying patterns. These outliers represent edge cases, not target customers.

We preserved their other sessions, so their typical behavior is still represented.

---

### Q19: "Can you explain the cohort funnel in simple terms?"

**Answer:**
**Visual explanation using the funnel:**

1. **Start:** All sessions in the database
2. **Filter 1 (Date):** Keep only recent sessions (after Jan 4, 2023) → Removes old, irrelevant data
3. **Filter 2 (Activity):** Keep only users with >7 sessions → Removes casual browsers
4. **Filter 3 (Age):** Keep only ages 18-100 → Removes minors and data errors
5. **Filter 4 (Outliers):** Remove extreme statistical outliers → Improves data quality

**Result:** 5,765 qualified users with clean, recent, engaged behavior patterns

Each filter serves a specific business or data quality purpose.

---

### Q20: "How do we know this cohort is representative of our target customers?"

**Answer:**
**The cohort represents exactly the customers Elena wants to target:**

1. **Recent activity:** Engaged within the current analysis period (not dormant)
2. **Established relationship:** Multiple sessions indicate genuine interest
3. **Legal compliance:** Age 18+ ensures we can market to them
4. **Clean data:** Outlier removal ensures algorithmic accuracy

**Validation metrics:**
- 7.52 sessions per user (healthy engagement)
- 26% booking conversion rate (strong intent)
- 0.26% cancellation rate (satisfied customers)
- Balanced flight/hotel bookings (diverse travel needs)

This is not a random sample - it's a **strategic subset** of your most valuable, targetable customers.

## Technical Follow-up Questions

### Q21: "Could we have used machine learning for outlier detection instead?"

**Answer:**
**We could, but it's overkill for this stage:**

**Advantages of IQR method:**
- Simple, interpretable, stakeholder-friendly
- No training required
- No hyperparameter tuning
- Industry standard
- Fast execution
- Works with any distribution

**If we used ML (e.g., Isolation Forest, LOF):**
- More complex to explain to non-technical stakeholders
- Requires hyperparameter selection
- Less interpretable ("the algorithm flagged it" vs. "it's 3x beyond the normal range")
- Results may vary with random seeds

**IQR is appropriate** for this use case. We reserve ML complexity for the actual segmentation task.

---

### Q22: "How would you handle this if you had to process 100x more data?"

**Answer:**
**Scalability strategy:**

1. **Database-side processing:** Move more logic into SQL (already doing this)
2. **Sampling:** Use stratified sampling for outlier detection
3. **Chunking:** Process data in batches
4. **Distributed computing:** Use Spark/Dask for parallel processing
5. **Incremental processing:** Process only new data, not full historical

**Current approach is appropriate** for 5,765 users. If scale increases significantly, we'd refactor for efficiency while maintaining the same analytical logic.

---

### Q23: "Why did you use LEFT JOIN instead of INNER JOIN for flights and hotels?"

**Answer:**
**To preserve browsing sessions without bookings.**

- **LEFT JOIN:** Keeps all sessions, even if no flight/hotel booking exists
- **INNER JOIN:** Would only keep sessions with both flight AND hotel bookings

**Why this matters:**
- Not every session results in a booking (browsing behavior is valuable)
- Users might book flights only, or hotels only, or neither
- We want to understand all engagement patterns, not just completed bookings

This decision allows us to segment users based on browsing behavior, conversion patterns, and booking preferences.

## Closing Questions

### Q24: "What's the most important takeaway from this notebook?"

**Answer:**
**We established a clean, validated analytical foundation.**

- **5,765 qualified users** with meaningful engagement patterns
- **High data quality** after systematic outlier removal
- **Documented methodology** that's reproducible and defensible
- **Ready for analysis** - no more data cleaning surprises

This foundation ensures that downstream analysis (feature engineering, clustering, perk assignment) will be based on reliable data. **Garbage in, garbage out** - we've ensured we're starting with quality inputs.

---

### Q25: "If you could only show one visualization from this notebook, which would it be?"

**Answer:**
**The Cohort Funnel** (`eda_cohort_funnel.png`)

**Why:**
- Shows the entire filtering process visually
- Demonstrates transparency in methodology
- Easy for stakeholders to understand
- Shows we're not arbitrarily removing data
- Displays final cohort size prominently

This single chart tells the complete story of how we arrived at our analytical cohort.
